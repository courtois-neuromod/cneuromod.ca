Hello, I am François Paugam, a PhD student and the one in charge of the special effects for the great videos we made for the CNeuromod month, our online progress report events. If you missed it, or if you are just curious to see what we are doing in the numerous and diverse branches of the CNeuromod project, or if you enjoyed the presentations so much that you want to watch them over and over, you can access them on our [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjeuWWEmZt5Zbx0LBiPbDJw).
Have a good time watching them, I hope you'll appreciate our cutting edge special effects.
