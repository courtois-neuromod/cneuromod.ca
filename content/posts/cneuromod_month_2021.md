Hi! I am Julie - Project manager for the Courtois Neuromod project and I am very happy to be able to announce the launch of our first ever CNeuromod  month! A totally virtual event during which members of the CNeuromod team and collaborators get to share with the rest of the team, and the community at large, their progress in the past year!


Every week we will present a series of 3 or 4 talks dealing with one of the CNeuromod objectives. Talks are all pre-recorded but  speakers will be available after their talks for a live Q&A period.  Expect to hear about team milestones, challenges related to intensive scanning,  new feats of engineering,  new dataset we‚Äôre developing, and lots of talks on  modelling on our Friends, Movie10 and video game data sets! Please join us for the live Q&A sessions armed with your questions, suggestions and  above all your scientific curiosity - we look forward to chatting with you!

Check out the schedule below and follow this link to register: https://forms.gle/TvkwWbgJu9gXhUFQ8 . Join us for all the talks or just the ones that are of particular interest to you - you choose. We will take care of sending you a reminder and the Zoom link a few days before.  

For those of you who cannot make a particular talk, talks will be posted on our YouTube channel (courtois.neuromod) at the end of the month. Follow us on twitter  ([@cneuromod](https://twitter.com/cneuromod)) to get up to date information about the CNeuromod Month and the project in general:
