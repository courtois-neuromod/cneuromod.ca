The Courtois NeuroMod project was made possible by a donation from the Courtois foundation. These funds are administered by the [Fondation Institut Gériatrie Montréal](https://www.figm.ca/) (FIGM) at [Centre de Recherche de l'institut Universitaire de Gériatrie de Montréal](http://www.criugm.qc.ca/en.html), part of [CIUSSS du Centre-Sud-de-l’île-de-Montréal](https://ciusss-centresudmtl.gouv.qc.ca/), as well as [University of Montreal](https://www.umontreal.ca/en/). The team has grown to include individuals from various institutions, and an up-to-date list of contributors can be found in the [documentation](https://docs.cneuromod.ca/en/2020-alpha/AUTHORS.html).
